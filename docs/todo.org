- The rewriter currently does not support performing a rewrite without renaming. Why is that?
- Renaming should not be needed, the worst it will do is make the lower to higher conversion invalid, because some base
  components will not be able to be moved under some connections.

- We need to recursively generate pures and then apply the branch-merge to pure conversion.

  switch out2 which was feeding the init to out1. The rest of the fork tree then lined up. But having a more general
  solution would be useful too.
