- Allows proofs using the the rewriter itself.
- Allows the proof of transformations using the existing rewrite rules.
- This could be done at runtime of the rewriter itself too, but this would provide more control.

:END:

- The rewriter currently does not support performing a rewrite without renaming. Why is that?
- Renaming should not be needed, the worst it will do is make the lower to higher conversion invalid, because some base
  components will not be able to be moved under some connections.

** Preprocessing of dot-graph for Dynamatic

*** TODO Split up read-only memory controllers intro their own banks

- Attached to a single load.

*** TODO Transform ~Merge~ into ~init Bool false~

- Remove the unnecessary additional input, and rewire the conditional input from in2 to in1.

*** TODO Rewire the fork trees

- I have found though that in all the cases for dot-graphs that you have sent me, the only thing I had to change is
  switch out2 which was feeding the init to out1. The rest of the fork tree then lined up. But having a more general
  solution would be useful too.

*** TODO Merge memories again

- Ideally, we wouldn't need to do this, but I guess that this is because don't know how to synthesise the right
  arguments for the memory controllers.

*** TODO Expand/Implement the tagger

- Either expand the tagger into the implementation of FPGA'24, or implement the tagger from scratch.
