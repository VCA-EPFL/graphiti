- GCD example cannot be converted in its current state due to the fact that the inner loop might not execute, which leads to a different DFG where there is an additional exit on the branch of the inner loop.
- When compiling the GCD, the default version works, however, substituting ~b~ with a constant 100 leads to a weird error in simulation. (Maybe this was because buffering was not happening).
- When turning the loop into a ~do while~ loop, the dynamatic compiler crashes.
- For MVT ~cst_16~ has the wrong type
