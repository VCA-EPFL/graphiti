-- What we want to do:
-- 路 Define flushability property on trace
-- 路 Say that we have a specification module on which flushability is true
-- 路 Assume the liveness_refinement between specification module and our module
-- 路 Show that this implies flushability on our implementation module
-- We could then try to exhibit such a specification module and try to prove the
-- property on it, and then prove the refinement.
